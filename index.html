        My name is Nolan and I am a Game Programmer. Growing up, most of my time was spent skateboarding and playing games with friends and siblings.
        I grew up with the Nintendo GameCube and my most played game was probably Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. My love for games is what started my journey to developing my own. 
        <br><br> 
        I started off self-taught and watched hundreds of YouTube videos about Scratch, GameMaker Studio, and Unity. 
        One YouTube channel that I've always had an interest in was Brackeys, and when I heard that they were hosting a Game Jam, I just had to participate.  
        These are great learning experiences since they get you used to working within a time limit and being limited to a theme.
        I had so much fun with this, and seeing all the positive comments on my game gave me the extra push I needed to pursue game development as a career.
        <br><br>
        I graduated high school as an Ontario Scholar and received my bilingual diploma for French and English.
        After this, I decided that I wanted to expand my skill set further and study Game Programming full time with a friend at St. Lawrence College in Cornwall, Ontario.
        During the Covid pandemic, a lot of my classes were held virtually, which led to me gaining experience with working remotely. 
        I have a lot of experience with C# and the Unity game engine and I am comfortable with many languages including C++, Python, HTML, and CSS.
        I am also familiar with Git and Github for version control.

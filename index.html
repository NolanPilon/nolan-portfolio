      Growing up, most of my time was spent skateboarding and playing video games with my friends and siblings.
      Our favorite games at the time were Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros, and Mario Party.
      My love for games is what influenced me to develop my own. I started off self-taught by watching hundreds of YouTube videos about GameMaker Studio and Unity.
      Where I learned the most, however, was when I participated in game jams.
      These are great learning experiences since they get you used to working within a time limit and being limited to a theme.

      I graduated high school as an Ontario Scholar and received my bilingual diploma for French and English.
      After this, I decided to go a little further than YouTube tutorials and study Game Programming full time with a friend at St Lawrence College in Cornwall Ontario.
      I have experience with many coding languages; however, I am most familiar with C#, C++, GML, HTML, and CSS.

      I hope to one day find employment in a game studio near me and in between searching for jobs, build and publish an indie game for Steam.

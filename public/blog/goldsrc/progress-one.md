# GoldSrc Map
## Check 1

-----

Hello, reader. Welcome to the first development blog for my Half-Life puzzle horror map. I started making mods and maps for GoldSrc games when I was a kid but never really took it too seriously. After finishing college, I thought I would revisit the J.A.C.K editor to improve my level design skills and relive some nostalgia. So far, I have some locked doors with destroyable locks, some vent crawling, audio cues, and a few combat encounters. I really enjoy the old way of brushing and texturing objects since you have to get creative with how you use the resources provided by Valve.

I really like the atmosphere I have created so far. There is very faint ambient lighting with flickering lights placed around important areas of the map. I plan to expand upon the map by using scripted events for unique combat encounters and puzzles, along with secrets that encourage exploration.

I'm excited to continue working on the map and exploring the many ways GoldSrc mapping tools can be used.

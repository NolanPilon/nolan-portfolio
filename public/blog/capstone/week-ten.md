# Capstone Progress 
## Week 10

-----

This week, I did a lot of work on the second main level of the game. This level is focused around a western theme with enemies like tumbleweeds, vultures, scorpions, and buffalo. We started with our weekly whiteboard meeting to better visualize some of the things we would be working on for the week. We designed this level to start outside of the big boss’s ranch. Passing through the ranch is the only way into the town... or is it? Some enemies the player may encounter include thieving crows and sentient tumbleweeds. As the player comes closer to the ranch, they fall into a sand pit leading them to an abandoned mine, infested with acid spitting scorpions. Luckily, the exit leads to the other side of the ranch, just outside of the town.

Now that we had an idea of what the level was going to look like, I got to work on the tile map. Fortunately, Will already went through the process of resizing and tiling the previous one so all I had to do was recolor it. I wanted this level to have more platforming sections and really take advantage of the movement systems we have in place. There are a lot more gaps and platforms in this one, especially in the mine section.

I really enjoyed doing some of the art assets in the previous level, so I decided to take a break from building the level, and decorate a little. I designed a tileable beam asset to be used in the mine support beams and fences for the ranch. I also got a little carried away and ended up drawing a sign and some horses for the entrance. There is even a little sign to tell the player that it’s probably not the best idea to trespass on the sheriff’s property.

I still need to implement the sand trap, place some enemies around the level, and add in some collectables, but so far, I’m really liking the feel of this one. I’m currently working with Will to fix some issues with the Crow and UFO AI before I move on to working on the next level. Next week, I would like to get as much work done as possible on the second boss level. I feel Hyangsu and I will be working together a lot this week since she has been doing most of the boss AI work. We will be designing his boss room around his attack patterns and decorate it to really feel like an office fit for a reptilian sheriff and his loyal deputies.

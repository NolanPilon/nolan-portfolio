# Capstone Progress 
## Week 1-2

-----

Hello, reader. Welcome to the first of many development blogs for our game programming capstone project. This blog will go over some of the work my team and I have accomplished during each week of our 14-week development time. The first two weeks involved a lot of brainstorming and preparation. We started week one by setting up the applications that we will be using for organization such as Jira, Confluence, and Discord. However, I made our Discord server about a week before the project officially started. I made some channels that I thought would be useful when documenting the development of a video game as a team and would add more if needed. We spent a lot of our first few hours as a group getting to know a bit about our strengths and throwing around ideas for our game. We came up with something we all agreed on and began work on the Game Design Document. This is where we expanded and finalized many of our ideas. We also selected a few technical challenges that we would like to try and implement. Joana, who is great at art, also gave us a few concept images for the art style we are going for.

After finalizing the Game Design Document, week two had begun, and we all began work on our Technical Design Documents. Will and I helped Kaleb out with some login issues on GitHub and Discord, but once these were resolved, everyone was on track. Kaleb is working on the UI/Menu system, Will is working on the AI, Joana is working on the art and music, and I am working on the combat mechanics. We are aiming to complete everyone’s TDDs by Wednesday (January 25th) so we can begin work on our prototype.

This week will be mostly spent reviewing and editing everyone’s Technical Design Documents for submission on Thursday (January 26th). We will also be stubbing out our Unity project to avoid merge conflicts and finalize some GitHub settings. By the end of the week, we should be able to begin work on programming.

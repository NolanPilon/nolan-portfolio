                <p class="text-xl mb-4">My name is Nolan and I am an Indie Game Programmer. Growing up, a lot of my time was spent skateboarding and playing video games with my friends and siblings. My favorite console is the Nintendo GameCube and my most played game was probably Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. My passion for games is what drove me to pursue game development and learn more about the technology that powers my favorite games.</p>
                <p class="text-xl mb-4">I started off self-taught, watched hundreds of YouTube videos and read many lines of documentation related to Scratch, GameMaker Studio, and Unity. One YouTube channel that I've always had an interest in was Brackeys, and when I heard that they were hosting a Game Jam one year, I just had to participate. Game Jams are excellent learning experiences since they get you used to working within a time limit and being limited to a theme. I had so much fun with this, and seeing all the positive comments on my game gave me the extra motivation I needed to pursue game development full time.</p>
                <p class="text-xl">I graduated high school as an Ontario Scholar and received my bilingual diploma for French and English. After this, I decided that I wanted to expand my skill set further and study Game Programming full time with a friend at St. Lawrence College in Cornwall, Ontario. During the Covid pandemic, a lot of my classes were held virtually, which led to me gaining experience with working remotely. I have a deep understanding and working knowledge of the Unity game engine and object oriented programming in C# and C++. I am also comfortable working in Python, HTML and CSS. While attending college, I had the opportunity to gain experience in version control with Git, project management with Trello and Jira, and collaboration on large scale projects.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-xl">I really enjoy working on large scale projects as part of a team and I hope to someday join the games industry. All of my work can be found on my Itch.io page and a majority of my code is uploaded to Github.</p>

                    This is the last blog for our capstone project. We started off the week with a mini showcase of our project to some students in the first year of the program. 
                    We had a lot of fun watching people break our game and play around with the movement mechanic. 
                    We got a lot of feedback around the difficulty of the game and how checkpoints work. 
                    The rare few people who made it to the first boss would sometimes manage to get it stuck in a corner if attacked from the right spot. 
                    While students were playing our game, some of us got our first looks at the other groups’ projects. 
                    Here is a picture of me taking notes while someone plays through our game.

                    After the showcase, we spent a lot of time fixing some bugs before our next showcase. 
                    I reworked how checkpoints work, so now anytime you fully die, you will respawn at the last flag. 
                    I also finally fixed the issue where you could spam the spacebar while inside a combo point to build a tone of momentum. 
                    The last issue I fixed is where the door for the first boss wouldn’t fully close and he would occasionally get stuck right in between it. 
                    Before the Level Up showcase, we all went through the game to see if there were any last-minute things to fix. 
                    One issue we uncovered was that the second boss would not re-cycle through his attacks if the player doesn’t attack him in time. 
                    While Hyangsu worked on a long-term fix for this, I whipped up a temporary fix for the itch build that loops through the same phase if you don’t attack the hit point and sent it off to the people at Level Up.

                    On the day of the event, Will and I put a build on a USB. 
                    We only had to bring a laptop and mouse since the event provided us with a large monitor. 
                    It was crazy to see all the different booths with everyone’s projects when we first walked in. 
                    A lot of teams had posters and shirts to promote their games which made us feel underprepared. 
                    After setting up our booth, our group walked around for a while to try out some games and get a feel for what we were competing against. 
                    There were so many unique ideas on display, each with their own art styles and gameplay. 
                    It was safe to say that we really didn’t stand a chance in the overall competition, but we were mostly there for the fun of it. 
                    We had a few people try our game and the common theme was that they found our mechanic to be very fun and unique.

                    Overall, I found the trip to be a great experience and although we didn’t win any awards, we had fun making and showing off our game. Even though our course is finished, we plan to continue working on our project and eventually might try to publish it on Steam. 
                    I’ve learned a lot over the past 14 weeks, and had a great time working with amazing people.
